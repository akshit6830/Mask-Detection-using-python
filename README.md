# Mask Detection using python , tensorflow and keras
it is a Deep Learning project in which the ai can identify if the person have mask or not . 

First run the MaskDetection.py to train the model for the mask detection . it will take some time 
the more time you will give to the computer , the better it will understand . 

the other file as MaskDetectionTest.py will take live webcam feed and show results  . 

you can see the results in the sample folder . 

Results :

with Mask :

without Mask :

I have also added the jupyter notebook files for comfort .
